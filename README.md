# Tools and Resources for AI Art

Looking to get started with AI art? A good place to start is one of the    like Wombo or NightCafe. You can get a quick sense of how you can use words and phrases to guide image generation. Read up on    to improve your results. Then you can graduate up to using Google Colab notebooks linked below like Disco Diffusion.  If you have a good nVidia GPU of your own then you can also use    to run the most popular notebooks locally. If you want to train your own Ai models check out the page.

There are a TON of shared Google Colab notebooks floating around for doing text to image with pre-trained GAN and diffusion models. I've been compiling the ones I come across and try out and find interesting. Please hit me up on twitter () if you know a cool notebook that I am missing! Disco Diffusion is most popular right now. @zippy731 made a great  and Quick-Eyed Sky has a nice  to help get you going.
